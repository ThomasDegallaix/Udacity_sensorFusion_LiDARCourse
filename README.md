This project was built as part of the Udacity Sensor Fusion Nanodegree Program thanks to the template code given by Aaron Brown.

My custom implementation of the segmentation and clustering functions can be found in processPointClouds.cpp. The KDTree structure has been added to processPointClouds.h.
